          <h1>Philosophy</h1>
          <p>
            The University of Batangas, a stock non-sectarian, private
            educational institution, believes in the pursuit of knowledge,
            values and skills necessary for the preservation and improvement of
            the Philippine society. It has faith in the dignity of the human
            person, in the democratic process, in the reward for individual
            excellence, and in the freedom of a person to worship God according
            to his conscience. Thus, the institution believes that the
            development of the individual as a person and worker is an effective
            means in building a better family, community and nation, and a
            better world.
